# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Project Description

WTWR (What to Wear?) is a back-end server for a weather-based clothing recommendation application. This API enables users to manage their profiles and share clothing items suitable for specific weather conditions. It supports user registration, authentication, and CRUD operations for clothing items. The back end is built using RESTful principles and interacts with a MongoDB database.

## Functionality

- User registration and login with hashed passwords
- CRUD operations for users and clothing items
- Weather-specific tagging for clothing items
- Like and unlike functionality for items
- Data validation and error handling

## Technologies Used

- Node.js – JavaScript runtime environment
- Express.js – Web application framework for building APIs
- MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing users and clothing items
- Mongoose – ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
- ESLint – JavaScript linting for code quality

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
